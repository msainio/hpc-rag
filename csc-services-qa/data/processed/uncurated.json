If your mesh is large, which normally implies lot or sub domains, lot of time (or iteration) steps, and all data, including lot variables, is written on disk, then, handling writing in those numerous output files become hard for Lustre file system, which is used on CSC's servers. It is good question of where is the limit when collated method should be used. if the number of sub domains (= processes) with non-collated method become larger than 120, I would use collated method - I don't see reason why not.

Note that the results might however be accurate only after the job has finished. Shell commands like sacct and seff can in principle be used in jupyter by adding an exclamation point before the command, e.g. `!sacct -j 1234567`. Seff will print the consumed billing units and to know if the requested resources were used optimally, check the CPU (or GPU efficiency) as well as the memory efficiency. These should ideally be close to 100%, although such a high efficiency is typically not possible. Just make sure that the efficiency is not too low. On mahti 50% CPU efficiency is also very good, since the calculation takes into account multithreading."

However, if you have lot of small job steps (or sub tasks) in your workflow, we advice submitting your job as a normal batch job with proper resoiurces  and use *local*   execution instead.  This means, all of your the sub tasks will be run inside of the same resource allocation. If you have too many small jobs (say several hundreds or even thousands), our suggestion in your case is to use HyperQueue executor (instead of slurm) where workers submit all of your sub-jobs to the same resource allocation (= everything happens in one batch job). For this, you should use the `--cluster` option and e.g. HyperQueue, see https://docs.csc.fi/apps/hyperqueue/#using-snakemake-with-hyperqueue"

HPC systems don't entertain the deployment of docker containers as the docker engine require root access for running the container. However, concepts of docker are quite useful for understanding otehr containers as well. Singularity/Apptainer containers are HPC-friendly and do not require root access for running container. You can convert a docker image to Apptainer/singularity.",

It's typically used in a setting where you provide services as containers.CSC uses similar but bit different framework called, OpenShift (which is a paid platform service from Red Hat UNLIKE Kubernetes (aka, k8s) is an open-source application from Google) in Rahti container cloud (https://rahti.csc.fi/)"

I don't feel that message comes across - not letting things interact with the cluster without batch script- given that one can load the snakemake module, and other modules, that are otherwise built to be able to send jobs to a cluster etc. But in snakemake you can specific cores etc, and my question therefore; shall resource allocation not be done at all and *only* be specified in the batch script (or shall it *also* be specified in the snakemake commands for resources)? Is it wrong to specify it within snakemake (even when I call snakemake from a batch script)?**",

And then expect to stay in queue for the execution of each rule as snakemake submits each of those rules  to cluster as a separate job (=slurm way of working).  On the HPC cluster, if you have thousands of small jobs,  each job creates some overhead on slurm database and the otehr performance issues. Submitting tiny job on a cluster cluster can be overkill. On the otherhand, even when you execute everything in one batch job,there will be local executor submitting the jobs to locally (=in the same job allocation) without needing to queue for each rule on that compute nodes. As and when you have very hight-thoughput case (like working with hundereds of samples), you can use Hyperqueue executor with multiple nodes to perform your jobs. So bottomline is that you are still using cluster capabilities but in a efficient manner."

You could for example use --ntasks=40 and --cpus-per-task=1 to use all cores in one Puhti node. Or you could also do --ntasks=2 and --cpus-per-task=20, or --ntasks=1 and --cpus-per-task=40.

This is the fundamental principle of supercomputing, i.e. we split a heavy calculation into smaller pieces, compute them in parallel, and then combine the results at the end.",
            "- A: Regarding information exchange, there are different types of parallel jobs. Sometimes the smaller pieces we split the job into are completely independent, in which case no information needs to be exchanged between them. This is sometimes called \"embarrasing parallelism\" or \"trivial parallelism\". Usually, however, the processes are not fully independent and information must be passed between the individual processes. Communication between processes is a very important topic when talking about parallel computing and is one of the reasons why you typically cannot just use arbitrarily many cores for your calculation, but the performance will level out at some point after which the performance does not improve anymore. There will simply be too much communication between the processes."

Alternatively, if you install a software and take care of adding binary paths and dependencies for it by yourself, that is just fine and no need to worrry about module system. In term of functionality there is no difference."

            "- A: CPU cores are what your program uses to run calculations and otherwise execute your program (from a computer's point of view, each step in your program is actually some kind of a mathematical operation or a series of them). Memory is what holds the numbers on which those calculations are currently carried out: this could be variables, arrays, images, text... Note that this is different from disk space though: even if you handle e.g. terabytes of images from disk, it might be that only one image at a time is loaded in memory if they are processed one at a time. It's not easy to give \"one size fits all\" answer that would cover all cases when it comes to determining how much resources your job needs, but here are some pointers that might help you:",

Good starting point is to check application documentation where you may find whether the application is memory intensive, parallelisable or has specific resource needs. Besdes,the software itself, the amount of data you are processing can also decide what kind of resources you need. Once you get some idea about the software you can start with small data and perform some pilot experiments with minimal resources. You can then scale up the resources and data as needed. Only experience will help us better. Obviously, you can always ask the developer of the tool to know more information instantly and have a head start."

There’s pencil, this side-by-side symbol, and an eye (see below for a screenshot). In eye view, you can’t edit, you are just viewing. The other two reveal the markdown (MD) version of the page, which you can edit. I find it easiest to edit with the side-by-side view, but it can be a bit slow sometimes. First time opening the page, the small Edit (pencil) button might be **on right** next to the table of contents.

Use of database in $LOCAL_SCRATCH will not cause any issues on parallel file system. It just requires that you have to stage and unstage it from local_scratch, otherwise database will be lost.

However, software on a supercomputer is managed through a management environment and that management environment needs an update also to support that newer kernel. So at the end updating ROCm requires updating the full software stack on LUMI and likely a week or more of downtime, and extensive testing before starting the process. There are only a few systems like LUMI in the world which also implies that the installation procedures are not thoroughly tested and that whenever a big update of LUMI is done, problems show up. Nowadays we have a test system to detect most of the problems before they are actually rolled out on the big systems, but in the early days we didn't and the first big update which was scheduled to take 3 weeks took 7 weeks in the end due to problems... So I hope you can understand why a big machine as LUMI is not the best environment if you want the very latest...

            "-   It may or may not and the answer is time-dependent. They are scheduled fairly independently. There was actually a mail after the last downtime to users to ask to use small/small-g more for jobs that can run in that partition. I'd have to check what the partition sizes are today, but the sysadmins at some point also moved some nodes from small to standard to try to balance the waiting times more. If those 2-minute jobs are also very small in node count (which I assume as you want to run them in small) and if the time you request is then also very low (like 10 minutes or so to be sure), they are ideal as backfill though and may start quickly on standard/standard-g actually and actually only use time that would otherwise been wasted. I've been rather successful with that strategy when preparing this and another course I am teaching about LUMI ;-) Sometimes my waiting times on standard/standard-g also became longer, and I assume an overloaded scheduler was partly to blame.",
            "So instead of asking standard with 48 hours request, asking small with say 1 hour (or smaller?) does not really change? another reason i use standard is because the model runs hardcored with 88 CPUs whether or not it is a preperation run or a production run.",
            "-   The element that really matters if you want your job to start quickly, is to be realistic with the time your request. If you know that it is something that finishes quickly, don't request the maximum allowed time. On standard and standard-g there is usually quite some room to run programs as backfill. The scheduler will schedule lower priority jobs on idle nodes that it is saving for a big job if it knows that that job will have finished before it expects to have collected enough nodes for that big highest priority job. If you always request the maximum wall time even if you know that it will not be needed, the job will never be used as backfill. But if you know a job will end in 5 minutes and then only request like, say, 10 minutes to have some safety margin, there is a high chance that the scheduler will select it to fill up holes in the machine. Nothing worse for a scheduler than all users just requesting the default maximum wall time rather than a realistic walltime as then it has no room to play with to fill up gaps in the machine.",

There are ways in which a job can crash where the scheduler fails to detect that the job has terminated and so keeps the allocation. It looks like in particular on LUMI some MPI crashes can remain undetected, probably because MPI fails to kill all processes involved. You will then be billed for the whole time that the job keeps the allocation, not for the time before it crashed."

Not that much on LUMI as we have a very low limit on the number of jobs, but no mail administrators would be happy with a user running a large array job on the cluster as each job in the array is a separate job and would send a mail. Imagine a user doing throughput computing and starting a few 1000s of jobs in a short time.... It might actually lead to mail systems thinking they're being spammed.",

        "answer": [
            "-   The problem is the way in which Slurm does GPU binding which is not compatible with GPU-aware MPI. I'm not sure how technical you are and hence if you can understand my answer, but let's try.",
            "    For CPUs Linux has two mechanisms to limit access to cores by a process or threads. One is so-called control groups and another one is affinity masks. Control groups really limit what a process can see and Slurm uses it at the job step level with one control group shared by all tasks in a job step on a node. That means that the tasks (processes) on a node can, e.g., share memory, which is used to communicate through memory. At the task/process level affinity masks are used which do not block sharing memory etc.",
            "    For GPU binding there are also two mechanisms. One is a Linux mechanism, again the control groups. The other one is via the ROCm runtime via the ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES mentioned during the presentation. You can compare this a little bit with affinity masks except that it is not OS-controlled and hence can be overwritten. The problem with `--gpus-per-task` is that Slurm uses both mechanisms and uses them both at the task level. The consequence is that two tasks cannot see each others memory and that hence communication via shared GPU memory is no longer possible. The funny thing is that Slurm will actually still set ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES also in some cases. So it is basically a bug or feature in the way Slurm works with AMD GPUs. It should use control groups only at the job step level, not at the task level, and then things could work.",
            "I don't use MPI, I only have ML applications in Python. Is this still a relevant problem?",
            "-   Yes, if you have multiple tasks. I gave MPI as the example but it holds for all communication mechanisms that go via shared memory for efficiency. RCCL for instance will also be affected. If you have something with `--ntasks=1` it should not matter though."

So for `fe00`: do not use core 0-7 (the last two 0's, so 8 zero bits), then the e corresponds to the bit pattern `1110` so do not use core 8 but use core 9, 10 and 11, and `f` corresponds to the bit pattern `1111` which is then use cores 12, 13, 14 and 15. So effectively: this concrete example means use CCD 1 (they are numbered from 0) except for the first core of that CCD which cannot be used because it is set aside for the OS and not available to Slurm."

As everybody involved in operatin LUMI learns over time and as use evolves, so does the amount of compute time that can be allocated. Each large supercomputer starts from the assumption that not all users will consume all their compute time so there is often more allocated than available, but how much changes over time as when people get more familiar with a computer, they tend to use a larger fraction of their allocation. In the first year of LUMI operations, we used a large so-called overallocation as too much compute time remained unused, but this has been lowered gradually to keep the lengths of the queue a bit under control."

I believe that with ROCm 6.3 they will start offering these compilers publicly as an alternative, and maybe by the end of next year or so they may become the default.

The Cray compiler can compile HIP code but needs the ROCm module also for tools it uses internally and I bleieve even during compilation for GPU-aware MPI.

LUMIs filesystems have huge bandwidth, but the number of file metadata operations: Open and close, e.g., may not be that much higher than on a much smaller cluster.

            "-   No, each node contains 8 GCDs. Typically you would run one task per GCD, so 8 in total. I think you may be confused with the number of CPUs that is available per GPU. On a LUMI-G node we have 64 CPU cores and 8 GPUs. So there are 8 CPUs per GPU, however since we operate the nodes in \"low-noise mode\" we reserve 1 CPU core for the OS. As a result you can only request 7 CPUs per GPU."

MPI trampoline is of that type: You link MPI trampoline in the application and then when you run you can chose between different MPI implementations. It also does not support Fortran according to its GitHub which already excludes some codes.",
            "    A similar example is FlexiBLAS for BLAS: You link to the FlexiBLAS libraries, but then at runtime you can chose between a number of options. So that only helps us in the container story if the applications in the container would be built with such an MPI library. To be fair, there are some that do runtime translation where the application is linked with one of the regular MPI libraries, and the portability library then pretends to be that library and translates calls instead to another MPI library. The `mpixlate` module on LUMI contains such a tool.",
            "    One problem with tools like MPI trampoline and FlexiBLAS is that you must ensure that when you compile an application, it picks up MPI trampoline and FlexiBLAS instead of the regular MPI libraries and whatever BLAS library you have on the system. Which may be less than trivial as few if any installer knows about those libraries and will auto-detect them as the first candidate,",

The \"more technical examples\" show how to use `lstopo` to understand what SLURM is doing and how it maps the hardware on the nodes.",
